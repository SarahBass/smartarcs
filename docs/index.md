SmartArcs is a suite of Garmin watchfaces. They were designed to be clean, minimalist and highly configurable. The suite consists of three watchfaces:
* **SmartArcs Origin** - simply focuses on time, nothing else ([download page](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/073e2cbc-f25e-44b9-ab59-4966fa5abbd6))
* **SmartArcs Active** - gives an overview of your daily activity (steps and floors) ([download page](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/3f5e481a-5f9e-4764-b2d5-5e9b174e2a98))
* **SmartArcs Trip** - shows useful trip data in two configurable data fields and two graphs ([download page](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/a1bfdf21-bde7-4d63-925f-a6a04cb84aff))

## Description
SmartArcs name comes from a common functionality to all three watchfaces. Colored arc indicators around the screen display watch statuses:
* **battery status**
* **number of phone notifications**. First notification is displayed as five minutes arc, each other as one minute arc.
* **Bluetooth status**
* **do not disturb status**
* **number of alarms**. First alarm is displayed as five minutes arc, each other as one minute arc.
Watchfaces are updated once each minute. Some watches support updating the watchface every second. On those watches SmartArcs can display also:
* **'always on' second hand**
* **heart rate**
*Note: SmartArcs currently does not support every second screen update on watches with AMOLED screen (Venu)*
